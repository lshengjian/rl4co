- [`1-decoding-strategies.ipynb`](1-decoding-strategies.ipynb): here we show how to use different decoding strategies at inference time, such as greedy evaluation, beam search, and various sampling methods including top-k and nucleus sampling.
- [`2-search-methods.ipynb`](2-search-methods.ipynb): here we show how to use search methods such as EAS for test-time optimization.
- [`3-change-encoder.ipynb`](3-change-encoder.ipynb): here we show how to change the encoder of a model.
